# Info

Directory contains sample scripts to prepare text and features for vocabulary for learning with word features instead of one hot word input.

The script requires Kaldi to be cloned into some directory see [Makefile.options](Makefile.options). Kaldi sources do not require to be built.

Scripts use input prepared by [bit-prepare2](../bit-prepare2)
